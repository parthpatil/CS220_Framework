CS220 Project Framework
===============
GRID ROUTING PROJECT BY KUSHAL SHAH AND PARTH PATIL

All algorithm implemented.
We have Implimented all the algorithms.

lee_grid.cc has Lee's algorithm, Aker's 2-bit and Aker's 3-bit.
ruben.cc has Ruben's algorithm.
korn.cc has Korn's algorithm.
hdlk_grid.cc has Hadlock algorithm.

->We have also considered multiple source and sink for all algorithm.
->We have ran our algorithm on Well. So It should be working perfactly with Well.


Notes:
1.Source named as -2, sink as -3 and blockers as -1 (For ruben's algorithm consider 70 as a source and 80 as a sink. And 100 as a obstacle. It can be changed to scale the algorithm at higher level with higher interger values.)
3.separate functions,headers and source files were created for each algorithm.
5.Added a feature to select algorithm by user.
